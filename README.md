Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

## Project Overview
W. Avy has requested additional data analysis on temperature trends in Oahu, specifically June and December. Comparing both the mid year and end of year statistics will allow W.Avy to determine if the business is sustainable year round.

## Results
By filtering the dataset to the specified date ranges, the following determinations were made:

  -The average temperature in Oahu in the month of June 2017 was about 75 degrees Farenheit, with most days in the mid to upper 70s. This statistics were based on 1500 recorded temperatures throughout June.

  -The average temperature in Oahu in the month of December 2017 was about 71 degrees Farenheit, with most days in the mid to lower 70s. This statistics were based on 1517 recorded temperatures throughout December.

  -When comparing the images above, the standard deviation of the temperatures for both months are within .5 of one another.
  These analyses suggest that temperatures are consistent and ideal to sustain the business year round.
  
  ## Summary
  In summation the weather conditions are both consistent and ideal to support the surf and ice cream shop business with the possibility of expansion in similar markets. Given access to more weather data, two additional queries relevant to this business types success would be:
  -frequency of recorded precipitation in a specified date range.
  -comparison of temperature trends between years(while 2017 looks like a great year for weather in Oahu, this may not be the case looking at 5 years worth of data).
The results of the queries suggested above would help determine if this is a sound business venture and not a trend.
